```bash
# Quick local setup
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

**Access:** `http://localhost:5000`

### Option 3: Replit Deployment
**Use Case:** Cloud-based backup with instant deployment

```bash
# Import to Replit
# 1. Visit replit.com
# 2. Import from GitHub

## 🛠️ Service Degradation Handling

### AI Service Fallbacks

#### Google Cloud AI Services Down
```python
# Automatic fallback to basic analysis
if not google_cloud_services_available:
    use_basic_text_analysis()
    show_degraded_service_notice()
```

#### Primary LLM Service Down
```python
# Fallback chain: Groq → Gemini → Static responses
try:
    response = groq_api.analyze(document)
except:
    try:
        response = gemini_api.analyze(document)
    except:
        response = static_fallback_analysis(document)
```

#### Translation Service Down
```python
# Fallback to basic translation or English-only mode
if translation_service_down:
    show_english_only_notice()
    disable_translation_features()
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Alerts

### Real-time Health Monitoring
```bash
# Continuous health checks
while true; do
    curl -f https://your-app.com/health || alert_team
    sleep 30
done
```

### Service Status Dashboard
- **Primary Deployment:** Monitor main application
- **Backup Services:** Check fallback options
