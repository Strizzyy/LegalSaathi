# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses issues with the document upload functionality in the Legal Saathi application. The current implementation may have TypeScript errors, accessibility issues, or runtime problems that prevent users from successfully uploading legal documents for analysis. The goal is to ensure a robust, accessible, and error-free document upload experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload legal documents without encountering JavaScript/TypeScript errors, so that I can successfully analyze my documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the file upload area THEN the system SHALL open the file browser without throwing any errors
2. WHEN a user selects a file THEN the system SHALL properly handle the file selection and display confirmation
3. WHEN a user drags and drops a file THEN the system SHALL process the file without runtime errors
4. IF there are TypeScript compilation errors THEN the system SHALL resolve all type-related issues
5. WHEN the component renders THEN all React refs SHALL be properly initialized and accessible

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper error handling during file upload, so that I understand what went wrong if an upload fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an invalid file type THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
2. WHEN a user uploads a file that exceeds size limits THEN the system SHALL show the specific size constraint
3. WHEN a network error occurs during upload THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error information
4. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight the specific field with the error
5. WHEN errors are cleared THEN the system SHALL remove all error indicators and messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the document upload to be fully accessible, so that I can use screen readers and keyboard navigation effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using a screen reader THEN all upload elements SHALL have proper ARIA labels and descriptions
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the upload area SHALL be focusable and activatable with Enter/Space
3. WHEN file selection occurs THEN screen readers SHALL announce the selected file information
4. IF errors occur THEN error messages SHALL be properly associated with form fields for screen readers
5. WHEN drag and drop is active THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate visual and auditory feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, maintainable code with proper TypeScript types, so that the upload functionality is reliable and easy to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the code THEN all TypeScript interfaces SHALL be properly defined and used
2. WHEN components render THEN all React hooks SHALL follow proper dependency management
3. WHEN handling file operations THEN all async operations SHALL have proper error boundaries
4. IF props are passed between components THEN all prop types SHALL be strictly typed
5. WHEN the component unmounts THEN all event listeners and refs SHALL be properly cleaned up
