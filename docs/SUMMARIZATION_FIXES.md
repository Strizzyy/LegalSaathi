# Document and Clause Summarization Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Document Summary Not Working Properly

**Problem**: The document summary feature was generating generic responses that didn't reflect the actual document analysis data.

**Root Cause**: 
- Insufficient context being passed to the AI service
- Lack of comprehensive fallback handling when AI services are unavailable
- Missing experience level integration in summary generation

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `generateJargonFreeVersion()` method with comprehensive context including:
  - Document type, risk level, and confidence scores
  - Risk breakdown (high/medium/low clause counts)
  - Actual clause examples with text and explanations
  - Key insights and recommendations
- Added `createDetailedFallbackExplanation()` for when AI services fail
- Integrated experience level personalization for appropriate language complexity
- Added proper error handling and logging

### 2. Clause Summary Context Issues

**Problem**: Clause summaries were not receiving proper context about the specific clause being analyzed.

**Root Cause**:
- Incomplete clause data being passed to the AI service
- Missing clause text, risk details, and implications in context
- Generic fallback responses that didn't reflect clause-specific information

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `createClauseSummary()` method with comprehensive clause context:
  - Full clause text and risk assessment details
  - Legal implications and recommendations
  - Risk level, score, severity, and confidence data
- Added `createFallbackClauseExplanation()` for detailed fallback responses
- Improved error handling with clause-specific fallback content
- Better integration with experience level service

### 3. Experience Level Not Maintained Throughout Session

**Problem**: User experience level preferences were not being consistently applied across all AI interactions.

**Root Cause**:
- Inconsistent experience level retrieval across different services
- Missing experience level context in AI requests
- No centralized experience level management

**Solution**:
- Created `ExperienceLevelService` for centralized experience level management
- Updated all AI-related services to use the experience level service
- Integrated experience level into cache keys to prevent cross-contamination
- Added experience level persistence in localStorage

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Context Structure

#### Document Summary Context
```typescript
{
  document: {
    documentType: string,
    overallRisk: string,
    summary: string,
    totalClauses: number,
    riskBreakdown: {
      high: number,
      medium: number,
      low: number
    },
    confidenceLevel: number,
    hasLowConfidenceWarning: boolean
  },
  clauseExamples: Array<{
    id: string,
    text: string,
    risk: string,
    explanation: string,
    implications: string[]
  }>,
  keyInsights: {
    severityIndicators: string[],
    mainRecommendations: string[]
  }
}
```

#### Clause Summary Context
```typescript
{
  clause: {
    clauseId: string,
    text: string,
    riskLevel: string,
    riskScore: number,
    severity: string,
    confidence: number,
    explanation: string,
    implications: string[],
    recommendations: string[],
    hasLowConfidence: boolean
  },
  document: {
    documentType: string
  }
}
```

### Improved AI Questions

#### Document Summary Question
```
Based on this legal document analysis, please explain what this document means for me in language appropriate for my experience level (${experienceLevel}). 

The document has ${totalClauses} clauses with an overall ${riskLevel} risk level. 

Key details:
- ${highRiskClauses} high-risk clauses
- ${mediumRiskClauses} medium-risk clauses  
- ${lowRiskClauses} low-risk clauses
- Analysis confidence: ${confidence}%

Please focus on:
1. What this document is trying to do
2. The main risks I should be aware of
3. What actions I should consider taking
4. When I might need professional help

Make it practical and actionable for someone at my experience level.
```

#### Clause Summary Question
```
Please explain this specific clause from a legal document in language appropriate for my experience level (${experienceLevel}).

Clause ${clauseId} Details:
- Risk Level: ${riskLevel}
- Text: "${clauseText}"

Please help me understand:
1. What this clause is trying to accomplish
2. How it affects me specifically
3. What risks or benefits it creates
4. Whether I should be concerned about anything
5. What action (if any) I should take

Make it practical and relevant to someone at my experience level.
```

### Fallback Handling

#### Document Summary Fallback
- Provides detailed explanation based on available analysis data
- Includes risk breakdown and recommendations
- Adapts language based on risk level
- Includes confidence warnings when appropriate
- Provides actionable guidance

#### Clause Summary Fallback
- Uses available clause data (text, risk level, implications)
- Provides risk-appropriate guidance
- Includes specific recommendations
- Maintains clause-specific context

### Experience Level Integration

- All AI requests now include user experience level
- Experience level affects:
  - Language complexity and terminology
  - Explanation depth and detail
  - Examples and analogies usage
  - Recommendation specificity
- Consistent experience level retrieval across all services
- Experience level included in cache keys

## Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage

## Benefits

### For Users
1. **Accurate Summaries**: Summaries now reflect actual document content and analysis
2. **Contextual Explanations**: Clause summaries include specific clause context
3. **Experience-Appropriate Language**: Content adapted to user's legal knowledge level
4. **Reliable Fallbacks**: Useful information even when AI services are unavailable
5. **Consistent Experience**: Experience level maintained throughout the session
