- **Real-Time Usage Display**: Shows current usage against daily limits
- **Rate Limit Monitoring**: Displays hourly rate limits and reset times
- **Visual Progress Bars**: Color-coded usage indicators (green/yellow/red)
- **Compact Mode**: Minimal display for integration into other components

### 4. Enhanced VoiceInput Component (`client/src/components/VoiceInput.tsx`)
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages and user feedback
- **Confidence Display**: Shows transcription confidence scores
- **Enhanced API Integration**: Uses new enhanced speech-to-text endpoints

### 5. API Enhancements (`main.py`)
- **Removed Generic Rate Limiting**: Replaced with user-specific rate limiting
- **New Usage Stats Endpoint**: `/api/speech/usage-stats` for real-time usage monitoring
- **Enhanced Request Handling**: Proper user context passing to controllers

### 6. Updated Models (`models/speech_models.py`)
- **Enhanced Response Models**: Added usage statistics and caching information
- **Validation Improvements**: Better input validation for speech requests

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

### Audio Validation
- File format validation (WEBM, WAV, MP3, OGG)
- File size limits (10MB maximum)
- Basic audio structure validation for WAV files
- Duration estimation and limits (5 minutes maximum)

### Cost Monitoring
- Daily usage tracking per user
- Automatic reset at midnight
- Usage statistics API
- Graceful degradation when limits exceeded

### Audio Caching
- MD5-based cache keys for audio content
- 1-hour TTL for cached audio
- Automatic cache cleanup
- Memory-efficient storage

### Rate Limiting
- User-based limits (authenticated vs anonymous)
- Service-specific limits (STT vs TTS)
- Hourly and daily windows
- Graceful error responses with retry information

### Multi-Language Support
- 10+ languages with neural voices
- Language-specific speaking rates
- Automatic voice gender selection
- Regional voice variants (US vs GB English)

## ðŸŽ¯ Integration Points

### Clause Assessment Integration
- Added `ClauseAudioButton` to `PaginatedClauseAnalysis.tsx`
- TTS buttons for each clause assessment
- Works with existing translation system
- Maintains clause context and explanations

### Global Language Support
- Integrates with existing translation system
- Respects user language preferences
- Supports translated content audio generation

### Authentication Integration
- Works with Firebase authentication middleware
- User-specific rate limiting and usage tracking
- Anonymous user support with reduced limits

## ðŸ“Š Performance Features

### Caching Strategy
- Client-side audio caching reduces server load
- Server-side audio caching reduces API costs
- Cache hit/miss tracking for optimization

### Rate Limiting Strategy
- Prevents API cost overruns
- Ensures fair usage across users
- Graceful degradation with informative error messages

### Error Handling Strategy
- Comprehensive fallback mechanisms
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry suggestions

## ðŸ”’ Security & Privacy

### Data Privacy
- No persistent storage of audio content
- Temporary caching with automatic cleanup
- User-specific usage tracking without content storage

### Rate Limiting Security
- Prevents abuse and API cost attacks
- User-based limits prevent single-user monopolization
- IP-based limits for anonymous users

### Input Validation
- Comprehensive audio file validation
- Size and format restrictions
- Malicious content prevention

## ðŸš€ Usage Examples

### Basic TTS Usage
```typescript
<AudioPlayer
  text="This clause requires your attention"
  languageCode="en-US"
  voiceGender="NEUTRAL"
  speakingRate={0.9}
/>
```

### Clause-Specific Audio
```typescript
<ClauseAudioButton
  clauseText="The tenant shall pay rent monthly"
  explanation="This means you must pay rent every month"
  languageCode="en-US"
/>
```

### Usage Statistics
```typescript
<SpeechUsageStats compact={true} />
```

## ðŸ”„ API Contract Compatibility

### Speech-to-Text API
- âœ… Maintains existing API contract
- âœ… Frontend expects 'transcript' field - backend returns 'transcript' field
- âœ… Enhanced with additional metadata (confidence, usage stats)
- âœ… Backward compatible with existing VoiceInput component

### Text-to-Speech API
- âœ… Maintains existing streaming response format
- âœ… Enhanced with cache headers and metadata
- âœ… Backward compatible with existing frontend code

## ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring & Analytics

### Usage Tracking
- Per-user daily and hourly usage statistics
- Service-specific usage (STT vs TTS)
- Cost monitoring and limit enforcement
- Real-time usage display in UI

### Performance Monitoring
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- API response times
- Error rates and types
- User behavior analytics

## ðŸŽ‰ Task Completion Status

All requirements from the task specification have been successfully implemented:

- âœ… Fixed existing speech-to-text API contract mismatch
- âœ… Implemented proper audio file validation for WEBM/WAV/MP3 formats
- âœ… Added comprehensive error handling for audio processing failures
- âœ… Created user-based rate limiting (10 STT, 20 TTS requests per user per hour)
- âœ… Implemented cost monitoring and daily usage limits
- âœ… Built text-to-speech functionality for clause assessments
